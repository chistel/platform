# Platform

Platform is an official, private repository containing many components used across my Laravel applications.

In order to utilise platform, first you must include it as part of your project, in your composer.json file:

```
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "git",
        "url": "git@github.com:chistel/platform.git"
    }
]
```

Then, add it to your packages configuration:

```
"chistel/platform": "^0.1",
```

Once done, composer update and away you go!
